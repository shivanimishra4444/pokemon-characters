# pokemon-characters

I took approximately 4.5 hours to finish this project. Below are the details

## Stack
 ReactJs, Typescript, RestAPI call, Bootstrap, FetchAPI, localStorage
## Completed features
0. UI is responsive to cater to standard mobile, tablet and desktop viewports
1. Create a web application to list all Pokémon and show paginated results
2. User should be shown the Pokémons in a card-based layout (click to see best practices)
3. Each card should contain the image of the Pokémon
   * Name
   * Height
   * weight
   * List of abilities
4. User should have option to choose the number of cards available per page available
    options are 10, 20 and 50
5. User should be shown previous and next links - on both the top
    and the bottom of the page
6.  User should be able to search through the Pokémon list using the name and abilities.
7.  User should be able to sort the result by name, height and weight.
9.  Page refresh should maintain the sorting and search related data(search data is not retained)
10. User should be taken to the details page and present all the information available for
    that Pokémon. The user should have a link to go back to the previous page.

## Other features
1. Have implemented clean design, ease of use, accessibility. maintainability and so on.
2. configurations to run the unit test and sample test.
3. configurations for production deployment
4. configurations for linting.


## Future improvements
1. performance can be improved overall very easily by using GraphQL.
2. UI cam be improved. Its very basic.
3. I can write only 1 unit test case due to time limitation. More unit test should be added.

## How to run the code
1. run - npm start
2. linting- npm run lint
3. prod build - npm buildprod
